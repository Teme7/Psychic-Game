# Psychic-Game

In this first ever Java Script assignment, I intend to design a game that allows a user to guess the correct letters the computer generates. Number of wins, losses, attempts, and guesses left will be displayed for the gamer to see. The user will have a certain number of chances to guess the letters correctly after which the game resets. Also after the specified number of attempts, the either the "Wins" or "Losses" will go up by one depending on the gamers success. "Attempts" and "Guesses Left" will have an inverse relationship as well.
