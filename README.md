# Psychic-Game

In this first ever Java Script assignment, I intend to design a game that allows a user to guess the correct letter(s) that the computer generates (from the list of words I provide). Number of "Wins", "Losses", "Attempts", and "Guesses Left" will be displayed for the gamer to see. The user will have a certain number of chances to guess (press) the letters correctly after which the game resets. After the specified number of attempts, either the "Wins" or "Losses" will go up by one depending on the gamer's success. "Attempts" and "Guesses Left" will also have an inverse relationship.
