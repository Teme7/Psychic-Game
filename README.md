# Psychic-Game

In my first ever Java Script assignment, I intend to design a game that allows a user to guess the correct letter that the computer randomly picks. Number of "Wins", "Losses", "Attempted Letters", and "Guesses Left" will all be displayed for the gamer to see. The gamer will have a certain number of chances to guess the letters correctly after which the game resets. After the specified number of attempts, either the "Wins" or "Losses" will go up by one depending on the gamer's success. "Attempted Letters" will only be displayed if the guess is wrong, upon which "Guesses Left" decrease by one. When the user's presses the letter key that matches with what the computer picks, then the "Attempted Letters" gets reset, and the "Wins" go up by one.
