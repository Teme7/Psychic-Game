        <!-- // Guess what letter I'm thinking of

            // Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

            // Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

            // Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

            // Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

            // When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

            // When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).  -->
